NUMBER 1 RANKED TEAM :
sdrawrofsitisaemaseht (#8): (2-0) on SparseForest,MagicWood.
    Dynamic Strategy, builds 1 Scout early which roams the map with his archon towards enemy archon, collecting bullets from trees.
    Buils 1 lumberjack then soldiers, or multiple lumberjacks if his scouts and archons encounter lots of trees.
    Lumberjacks only clear nearby trees, soldiers rush enemy archon if spotted.
    Does not care about trees which contain robots, clears trees randomly.
    Does not keep soldiers for defense, sends everyone to attack.(Lumberjacks might defend though)
    Does not take victory points, prefers to build units.
Possible Counter:
    Defend against early scouts, get their gardeners first.
    If map is pathfinding heavy, just turtle up while defending against singular attackers.
Copy their:
    Early game harrass.
    Spawn pattern for units.

Programmer-at-Arms (#366): (2-0) on DenseForest,MagicWood.
    Gardener micro similar to ours.
    Builds scouts early rushes.
    Builds lumberjacks next, prioritize trees near archon.
    Soldiers defend center of map.
Possible counter:
    Similar to sdraw.
Copy their:
    Nothing.

4th place (#492): (2-0) on Barrier,Enclosure.
    Archons move around and drop Gardeners,who build trees in place.
    Gardeners never move unless enemies nearby.
    Gardeners spawn lumberjack->soldier or scout->soldier repeatedly.
    Only takes victory points if he has 10000 bullets.
Possible Counter:
    Attack him first or defend against his initial attack.
    If his archon dies, gardeners are vulnerable as they tend to move out of their tree ring.
Copy their:
    Archon movement, but make it more unpredictable.

Waterloo Omega Ruby (#133): (2-1) on SparseForest,shrine,hurdle.
    Builds defensive ring of soldiers and lumberjacks around his archon, slowly expanding towards enemy archon.
    Doesn't attack, only defends.
    Strong defense, can't break defense mid to late game.
    Sends scout towards enemy archon, but doesn't attack it?!
    Gardeners plant trees spaced out.
Possible counter:
    Just build lots of gardeners and farm bullets before he reaches you.
    His defense can be broken by rushing early game with scouts, once his defense is broken, send lumberjacks as his gardeners are not enclosed.
Copy their:
    Defense.

Super Cow Powers (#764): (2-0) on DenseForest,SparseForest.
    Builds scouts and lumberjacks.
    Scouts rush, lumberjacks clear trees; if no nearby trees, lumberjacks also rush.
    Gardeners build trees in a line, rather than surrounding themselves.
Possible counter:
    Defend and build trees faster.
Copy their:
    Nothing.

Simplex (#89): (2-0) on Hurdle,Enclosure.
    Similar to sdraw, but only builds scouts throughout the game.
Possible Counter:
    Same as sdraw
Copy their:
    Scout movement.

Team Amyr (#473): (2-0) on Barrier,Enclosure.
    Only builds gardeners, Gardeners plant trees randomly but stay in the area to water them, surround themselves with trees after some turns.
    Wins by reaching 1000 victory points faster.
    Archon has almost no defense.
Possible Counter:
    Build scouts early and hunt gardeners.
We could have won if:
    Our gardeners had better spacing.
    Our archon spawned gardeners in correct direction.
    Devoted all resources only to bullet farming rather than lumberjacks.
Copy their:
    Nothing.

PeopleMountainPeopleSea (#36): (2-0) on Barrier,DenseForest.
    Builds some lumberjacks initially, afterwards completely surrounds gardeners with trees.
    Has very good spacing.
Possible Counter:
    Build scouts and hunt.
We could have won if:
    Our lumberjacks got them faster.
Copy their:
    Spacing strategy.


TODO :

Possible Strategy:
    Build scouts and soldiers early.
    Hunt Gardeners first then archon.
    If they only have a single archon hunt him first.
    Build atleast one soldier early for defense only.

Improvements over current:
    Soldiers and scouts should avoid bullets.
    Avoid friendly fire.
    Gardeners need better spacing.
    Archon needs better spawning pattern.
    Archon needs better movement.
    Archon needs to spawn gardeners properly.
