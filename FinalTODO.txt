^1. Better spawning. //DONE , now archon tries to spawn in any direction possible. 
^2. Reduce dependency on primary archon. (Archon should spawn even if there are friendlies in the sesne radius) //DONE
^3. Gardener should dodge bullets.  //   DONE but needs to be checked.

4. Add bugnav wherever possible.    // Try and test putting bugnav in respondToBroadcast functions for scout and soldier.(Make sure it returns when reached using isWithinDistance)

^5. Don't gather everyone on location. //DONE but soldiers tend to gather if no global broadcasts present.

6. Try to get archon to move to safe location early. (Careful on small maps)

^7. Better scout harass.  //Current is good enough, scout should primarily hunt bullets.

8. Soldier dodging.

^9. Wander to enemy broadcast locations. //DONE
^10. Broadcast all initial archon location in the beginning itself. //DONE!
^11. If enemy health is less than 40%, make him myEnemy.            //DONE!
^12. Increase scout bullet hunting period. Harass enemies if found, still keep trying to find bullet trees. //The hunting period now is good enough.

13. Soldiers should stand at their place and trydodge rather than move due to ifhasnotmoved condition.

^14. Lumberjacks should run away from tanks.             //DONE
^15. Lumberjacks should cut trees when path to enemies is blocked.   //DONE kind of ,Difficult to determine when this condition occurs as we can't reliably detect if path is blocked.
^16. Lumberjacks should only cut trees if it has archon,gardener,tank or if its health is less than some threshold. (probably around 1000) //DONE
^17. Improve scout micro.                //  DONE. Test if possible.
    -- Archon,gardener,scout -> shoot
    -- tank -> broadcast and run away.
    -- soldier,lumberjack -> run away staying in range if possible.
    -- default -> find trees with bullets.
^18. While shooting lumberjacks, if more enemies in that direction then shoot pentad instead. //DONE

19. Tanks should not try to walk over friendly trees if possible.
20. If any robot can shake tree while wandering, shake it.

NOTE: Have created a function willmybullethit() in basebot. It checks for trees and enemies in between our location and given robotinfo and return true or false. Try to use it wherever useful.
Currently theBot is better than finalBot but i think it will change once all the changes have been done.
